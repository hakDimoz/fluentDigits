# Fluent Digits
Helps language learners learn numbers in their target language

## How it Works
1. Choose your target language and the numbers you want to practice
2. Audio of a random number in target language will play
3. Type what you think the number is
4. Try and build a streak of correct answers

## What I Learnt by Completing this Project
This project was quite monumental for me as it was the very first fullstack web app that I deployed and that got real users.
The most interesting thing was seeing how users interacted with the system. Some would do things I would never have thought 
could be done. Some users also had issues with a potentially overwhelming UI, so it was interesting adressing these 
concerns. 

I got lot's of constructive feedback which has improved my programming skills and knowledge a lot! 
For example I learnt about the inputmode attribute in html which I had never heard of before. 

This experience allowed me to gain a deeper appriciation for the amount of effort needed to build an app 
that satisfies most users. Even in this small app I built there were so many things to improve on that I didn't 
realise until I got feedback. 

## The Stack I used
**Angular** - It is the frontend framework I am most comfortable with. I was able to learn more about new features 
such as signals. I also feel the skills I make in angular are quite transferrable to other framworks like react.

**Express** - Express really makes you do eveything yourself as it is not opinionated, which I honestly dont really like. 
It is quite a contrast to angulars philosophy. In my next project I'm going to try Nestjs. 

**Google Cloud TTS** - Used to generate the audio of the numbers.
